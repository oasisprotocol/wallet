# Change Log Fragments

This directory collects Change Log fragments:
short files that each contain a snippet of Markdown formatted text that will
be assembled using [towncrier] to form the [Change Log] section for the next
release.

This repository follows the same Change Log fragments style as the
[Oasis Core] repository.
Please, see [its Change Log fragments documentation] for more details.
